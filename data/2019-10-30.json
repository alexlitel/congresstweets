Please contact your Senators and members of Congress and urge them to make sure that the elimination of the Widow’s Tax for our surviving veteran spouses is included in the final Nat’l Defense Authorization Act! Thanks @jaketapper https://twitter.com/sendougjones/status/1189663734916165632 QT @SenDougJones It's time for Congress to put its money where its mouth is when it comes to supporting our troops. \n\nMy bill to eliminate the Military Widow's Tax has the support of over 3/4 of the Senate AND the House, so there's no excuse. Let's make this the year we finally #AxeWidowsTax. http://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1189663623846735874/pu/img/yI20aj8nxtPW4-NS.jpg https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1189663623846735874/pu/vid/480x270/oKC5GBacLlUczu2C.mp4?tag=10","source":"Twitter for iPad"},{"id":"1189724716199792642","screen_name":"LacyClayMO1","user_id":"584912320","time":"2019-10-30T22:04:11-04:00","link":"https://www.twitter.com/CAGoldenBear/statuses/1189722043907895297","text":"RT @CAGoldenBear “How Cruel!” @LacyClayMO1 NAILS #KenCuccinelli for demanding critically ill kids abandon medical care &amp; leave the country. http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EIK947QWsAA3SGz.jpg","source":"Twitter for Android"},{"id":"1189724631697108992","screen_name":"HawleyMO","user_id":"2352629311","time":"2019-10-30T22:03:50-04:00","link":"https://www.twitter.com/HawleyMO/statuses/1189724631697108992","text":"The night before Halloween! http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EILAPUoXUAA0kzw.jpg","source":"Twitter for iPhone"},{"id":"1189724609089810433","screen_name":"LacyClayMO1","user_id":"584912320","time":"2019-10-30T22:03:45-04:00","link":"https://www.twitter.com/Mjporcelli/statuses/1189723375737987073","text":"RT @Mjporcelli @LacyClayMO1 brave man.","source":"Twitter for Android"},{"id":"1189724495294222337","screen_name":"LacyClayMO1","user_id":"584912320","time":"2019-10-30T22:03:18-04:00","link":"https://www.twitter.com/ThereseMary76/statuses/1189724341904252928","text":"RT @ThereseMary76 #bravo @LacyClayMO1! “How cruel” is exactly how most Americans feel. #howcruel https://twitter.com/dcexaminer/status/1189672401803644928 QT @dcexaminer Rep. @LacyClayMO1: \"So you don't care.\"\n\n@USCISCuccinelli: \"You BET I care … If you cared enough to pass a law, we'd enforce it.\"\n\nClay and Cuiccinelli clash on letters ordering families with sick children to leave the country.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/cuccinelli-hits-democrats-over-inaction-on-deporting-medically-ill http://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1189671658333900800/img/9s1O5luQsXwm8P7A.jpg https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1189671658333900800/vid/480x270/9YBbRg37gxxGNlq3.mp4?tag=13","source":"Twitter for Android"},{"id":"1189724341497421830","screen_name":"chiproytx","user_id":"1257667158","time":"2019-10-30T22:02:41-04:00","link":"https://www.twitter.com/chiproytx/statuses/1189724341497421830","text":"God bless y’all my friend. https://twitter.com/jodyhice/status/1189356997457666048 QT @JodyHice We lost my Dad today.\n\nTom Hice was a godly man, family man, business man, and a humble, gentle man.
