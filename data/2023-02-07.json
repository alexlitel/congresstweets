Starting January 1st, the cost of insulin was capped at $35/month for Steve and other Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nWe must expand the Insulin cap to everyone. #SOTU https://twitter.com/janschakowsky/status/1580296170051543040 QT @janschakowsky If the Inflation Reduction Act‚Äôs $35 insulin cap was in effect in 2020, a Medicare beneficiary in my district enrolled in a Medicare plan could've saved $1,433 per year. This is a matter of life and death.
