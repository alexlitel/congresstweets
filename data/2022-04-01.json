Gallego's sentiment to Army veteran Chris Buckley:\n\nThank you for sharing your powerful story and for the work you are doing to help fellow veterans avoid going down a path of domestic violent extremism. https://twitter.com/RepRubenGallego/status/1509639745055375368 QT @RepRubenGallego Extremism doesn't happen in a vacuum. Hate groups seize on veterans looking for purpose after serving their country.\n \nLook no further to Jan. 6 to see what happens when hate groups are successful. That's why it's critical we support veterans as they transition to civilian life. http://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1509628810282651657/img/fMEoZVZM2PHvvnIB.jpg https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1509628810282651657/vid/480x270/HDijwyQTktY2ZZJa.mp4?tag=14","source":"Twitter Web App"},{"id":"1509914810405859335","screen_name":"HouseDPCC","user_id":"3027286779","time":"2022-04-01T11:25:18-04:00","link":"https://www.twitter.com/JECDems/statuses/1509907494621040640","text":"RT @JECDems JOBS DAY: The #JobsData has shown continued economic growth under @POTUS, including: \nüíº431,000 jobs added\n‚¨áÔ∏èThe unemployment rate dropped to 3.6%, nearly pre-pandemic levels\n#JobsDay üßµ‚¨áÔ∏è http://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPRDKpkXMBEs53T.jpg","source":"Twitter Web App"},{"id":"1509914651001298952","screen_name":"tammybaldwin","user_id":"87510313","time":"2022-04-01T11:24:40-04:00","link":"https://www.twitter.com/Tony4WI/statuses/1509914573641506832","text":"RT @Tony4WI Tuesday is Spring Election Day but in communities across Wisconsin, you can Early Vote today!
