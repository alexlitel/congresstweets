Jacquie and I send our condolences to Kathryn and the family. https://twitter.com/thauserkstp/status/1324586109586886657 QT @thauserkstp Minnesota lost a great public servant tonight. Former GOP Congressman Jim Ramstad passed away after a lengthy illness. He was a rare breed of politician who could work with Democrats and Republicans. He served the 3rd District from 1991-2009 and served the MN Senate from 1981-91. http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EmHgCykWoAEFx-9.jpg","source":"Twitter for Android"},{"id":"1324765885572153351","screen_name":"SenGillibrand","user_id":"72198806","time":"2020-11-06T12:29:34-05:00","link":"https://www.twitter.com/92Y/statuses/1324742085182803973","text":"RT @92Y We were honored to have @staceyabrams on our virtual stage in June, talking w/ @SenGillibrand about fair elections, voter suppression &amp; the electoral system.
